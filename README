WHAT IS BERA?
============================================================
Bera is a backup system designed to easily backup and restore or migrate a Linux server in minutes.

Backup all important files, folders, services configuration from a Linux server. Yet more important, you 
can easily restore them in the same server or migrate them to a new one. Perform a full backup and restoration in 
less than 10 minutes (depending upon the size of data).

Backup everything you need from your server:
	· Important files/folders or services configuration
	· Sytem configuration (users, crontabs, iptables...)

Features:
	· Migrate a complex Linux server in less than 10 minutes
	· Easy configuration and usage
	· Exclude domains to backup
	· Exclude files and folders from the backup using regex expressions
	· High speed for incremental backups
	· Reliable backup based on rsync
	· Secure communications using SSH
	· Shows a detailed report while working to see progress
	· Keeps user ownerships and permissions
	· Freely distributable source and executable (GPL license)

Development background:
	· Developed by our in-house tech staff 
	· Tested in live with our own servers and websites


HOW TO
============================================================
Bera helps you with most of the tedious work of restore or migrate a Linux server. But you need a first step:
	1. Set up the server: Install the SO, config network, install packages...
	2. Then, use Bera to download service configurations, files, folders...


BERA REQUIREMENTS
============================================================
· Linux server (tested on CentOS)
· rsync
· SSH
· Root access to both systems (required to backup/restore some services configuration)


INSTALLATION
============================================================
Just upload both files to your server and set proper permissions:
	chmod +x bera-backup.sh
	chmod +x bera-restore.sh

Each script needs a config file. You have an example of each at:
	_bera_restore_config_example
	_bera_backup_config_example


USAGE
============================================================
./bera-backup.sh PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
Creates a backup of the server in the specified folder

./bera-restore.sh PATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE
Downloads the backup from the backup server (or same server) and restores it.

KNOWN ISSUES
============================================================
- "Permission denied" when downloading backups. Example: 
	rsync: send_files failed to open "/home/.../qr.png": Permission denied (13)
As Bera tries to keep permissions and ownerships untouched, this kind of error can arise if the files has very restrictive permissions.
